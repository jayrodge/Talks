# talks

This repository contains materials on talks I've given at various meetups or events.

The directories contain source files used to create the talks as well as the slides used for the talk.

If you attended one of these talks and have follow-up questions:

1. Thank you so much for attending!
2. Open [an issues](https://github.com/jayrodge/talks/issues) or email me at jayrodge@live.com
